# AGENTS.override.md — Apps/CloudX

This override applies to the entire `CloudX` app target directory. Read the root `AGENTS.md` first.

**Modernization contract reference:** For app-target work governed by the modernization program, use `Docs/CloudX_Modernization_Contracts.md` as the canonical Floor/Execution contract reference, together with `Docs/CloudX_Modernization_Plan.md`, `Docs/CloudX_Monolith_Breakdown.md`, and `Docs/CloudX_File_Matrix.md`.

**Skill policy reference:** Use the root AGENTS skill policy together with `Docs/CloudX_Skill_Policy.md`. For app-target work, default to `[$ios-skills:ios-skills-router](/Users/nicholas/.ios-skills/skills/_router/SKILL.md)`, `[$ios-skills:swiftui-pro](/Users/nicholas/.ios-skills/skills/twostraws--swiftui-pro/SKILL.md)`, `[$ios-skills:swift-concurrency-pro](/Users/nicholas/.ios-skills/skills/twostraws--swift-concurrency-pro/SKILL.md)`, and `[$ios-skills:swift-accessibility-skill](/Users/nicholas/.ios-skills/skills/pasqualevittoriosi--swift-accessibility/SKILL.md)` before editing UI or focus/navigation code.

## What this directory is

`Apps/CloudX/` is the single tvOS app target. It contains:

- `Sources/CloudX/` — all production Swift source files
- `Tests/CloudXTests/` — unit tests grouped by feature area
- `Tests/CloudXUITests/` — shell checkpoint and UI regression tests grouped by function
- `Tests/CloudXPerformanceTests/` — performance tests grouped by function
- `Tests/CloudXPerformanceUITests/` — performance UI tests grouped by function
- `CloudX.xcodeproj/` — Xcode project file

---

## Project file rules

The Xcode project file (`CloudX.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`) is the source of truth for which files are compiled, which test targets they belong to, and what build settings are active.

When you add, move, or delete a Swift source file, you must also update `project.pbxproj` to reflect the change. Failing to do so means the file will be excluded from builds or tests silently.

Do not change the following build settings without an explicit reason:
- `SWIFT_VERSION = 6.2`
- `SWIFT_STRICT_CONCURRENCY = complete`
- `TVOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET = 26.0`
- `OTHER_SWIFT_FLAGS = -DWEBRTC_AVAILABLE`

## App Skill Routing

Use these additional skills when the work matches:

- `[$ios-skills:swiftui-view-refactor](/Users/nicholas/.ios-skills/skills/dimillian--swiftui-view-refactor/SKILL.md)` for large SwiftUI host/container files such as CloudLibrary shell and route hosts
- `[$ios-skills:swiftui-performance-audit](/Users/nicholas/.ios-skills/skills/dimillian--swiftui-performance-audit/SKILL.md)` for route switching, focus churn, and expensive view recomposition
- `[$ios-skills:swiftui-uikit-interop](/Users/nicholas/.ios-skills/skills/dpearson2699--swiftui-uikit-interop/SKILL.md)` for streaming/rendering bridge surfaces
- `[$ios-skills:swiftui-liquid-glass](/Users/nicholas/.ios-skills/skills/dimillian--swiftui-liquid-glass/SKILL.md)` for tvOS 26 shell chrome/material work
- `[$ios-skills:debugging-instruments](/Users/nicholas/.ios-skills/skills/dpearson2699--debugging-instruments/SKILL.md)` for AVFoundation, rendering, streaming, and performance investigations
- `[$ios-skills:xcodebuildmcp](/Users/nicholas/.ios-skills/skills/getsentry--xcodebuildmcp/SKILL.md)` or `[$ios-skills:ios-debugger-agent](/Users/nicholas/.ios-skills/skills/dimillian--ios-debugger-agent/SKILL.md)` for simulator/device validation
- `[$ios-skills:swift-testing-expert](/Users/nicholas/.ios-skills/skills/avdlee--swift-testing-expert/SKILL.md)` for any pure-Swift test migration inside app tests, while keeping XCUI work on XCTest

## Test target rules

**CloudXTests** — unit tests
- Framework: currently XCTest, migrating to Swift Testing
- Scope: state machines, data shaping, routing, focus, streaming surface model
- One test file per type under test, named `[TypeName]Tests.swift`
- Do not put UI automation here

**CloudXUITests** — shell checkpoint UI tests
- Framework: XCTest + XCUI (must stay XCTest)
- Current state: shell checkpoint coverage is already split across helper/support files plus the remaining root test classes
- Do not add Swift Testing imports here

**CloudXPerformanceTests** — performance measurements
- Framework: XCTest
- Use the `CloudX-Perf` scheme for runs
- `PerformanceTestSupport.swift` is a `@MainActor enum` containing launch argument constants and app factory helpers. Lower priority than other splits. Tracked as EF-6.

**CloudXPerformanceUITests** — performance UI scenarios
- Framework: XCTest + XCUI
- Use the `CloudX-Perf` or `CloudX-ShellUI` scheme

## Current modernization posture in this target

The major floor-blocker file moves, dissolutions, and merges for the app target have already landed. Treat the current app structure as the baseline unless a new approved modernization wave says otherwise.

The remaining work in this target is follow-up quality work:

- keep route/action closures explicitly `@MainActor`
- avoid reintroducing passthrough wrappers that were already dissolved
- keep tests domain-shaped instead of rebuilding monolithic test roots
- keep shared/theme and streaming/rendering seams aligned with the current split
