## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0-alpha] — 2026-04-07

### Initial public release

First public open-source release of CloudX — a native tvOS Xbox Game Pass cloud gaming client for Apple TV.

### What works

- Microsoft device-code sign-in with full token lifecycle and automatic refresh
- Cloud library browsing: home rails, full library grid, search, and title detail screens
- xCloud game streaming (primary cloud streaming path)
- xHome console streaming (local Xbox console remote play)
- Controller input capture and 125 Hz input channel to server
- Metal-backed video rendering with sample-buffer fallback
- In-stream guide overlay with settings and stats
- Library persistence: disk-cached, restored across launches
- Xbox profile, presence, and achievements API integration
- Diagnostics, in-stream stats, and logging pipeline

### Known limitations

- Single Microsoft account only (no multi-account support)
- No party or invite features
- Stereo audio requires a custom WebRTC build flag; mono by default with the vendored binary
- Auto-reconnect exists but is conservative — not seamless
- Some documentation sections are still being refined

### Requirements

- Xcode 26+
- Swift 6.2
- tvOS 26.0
- Apple Silicon Mac recommended
