CloudX is a native tvOS app that brings Xbox Game Pass cloud gaming to Apple TV. It is a native Swift implementation of the xCloud and xHome client experience for tvOS, built because Apple TV has no browser runtime and Microsoft does not make an official Apple TV app.

While CloudX is implemented natively in Swift, it draws on protocol and API knowledge established by earlier open-source community work around xCloud and xHome. This repo contains the tvOS-native client, application architecture, rendering, input, authentication flow, and streaming integration needed to make that experience work on Apple TV.

## Credits

This project builds on protocol and API knowledge from earlier community projects, especially:

- [unknownskl/greenlight](https://github.com/unknownskl/greenlight) — open-source xCloud/xHome client
- [unknownskl/xbox-xcloud-player](https://github.com/unknownskl/xbox-xcloud-player) — WebRTC player and streaming groundwork

CloudX is not a direct port of those codebases. It is a native tvOS implementation in Swift, but it would be inaccurate to present the project without acknowledging the earlier community work that helped establish understanding of these services and protocols.

## What Is This, Exactly?

Xbox Game Pass Ultimate lets you stream Xbox games over the internet — a service Microsoft calls **xCloud**. When you play an xCloud game, the actual game is running on a server in a Microsoft datacenter. The video is encoded and streamed to your device over WebRTC, and your controller inputs are sent back the same way. You get a full Xbox game on your device without needing powerful local hardware.

Apple TV has no browser and Microsoft has never released an official Apple TV app, so there is no first-party way to use xCloud on tvOS. CloudX fills that gap by implementing the xCloud client protocol natively in Swift.

CloudX also supports **xHome** streaming. If you own an Xbox console, you can stream from that console directly to your Apple TV instead of going through Microsoft's cloud servers. xHome has lower latency when your Xbox and Apple TV are on the same network, and it doesn't require waiting in a cloud capacity queue.

> **Game Pass required for streaming.** You do not need an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription to build, read, or explore the code. You do need one to sign in and actually stream games.

| Microsoft device-code sign-in | ✅ Working | Full token lifecycle with automatic refresh |
| Cloud library browsing | ✅ Working | Home rails, full library grid, and search |
| Title detail screens | ✅ Working | Metadata, artwork, launch actions |
| xCloud game streaming | ✅ Working | Primary streaming path, battle-tested |
| xHome console streaming | ⚠️ Not Fully Tested | Local console streaming over home network |
| Controller input | ✅ Working | Gamepad capture and 125 Hz input channel |
| Metal video rendering | ✅ Working | Metal-backed renderer with sample-buffer fallback |
| In-stream guide overlay | ✅ Working | Accessible overlay during active streams |
| Library persistence | ✅ Working | Disk-cached, restored across launches |
| Profile and achievements | ✅ Working | Xbox social API integration |
| Diagnostics and stream stats | ✅ Working | In-stream stats overlay and logging pipeline |
| Multi-account support | ❌ Not yet | Single Microsoft account only |
| Party and invite UX | ❌ Not yet | No group play features yet |
| Seamless auto-reconnect | ⚠️ Partial | Reconnect exists but is conservative |

For the full breakdown of what works, what is partial, and what is explicitly planned, see [`Docs/FEATURE_INVENTORY.md`](Docs/FEATURE_INVENTORY.md).

### Known rough edges

A few things are deliberately not finished yet and are worth naming upfront so they do not surprise you:

- **Multi-account:** The app assumes one Microsoft account at a time. Switching accounts requires signing out completely.
- **Party and invites:** No group play, no invites, no friend-session joining. This is a significant gap for social gaming but is on the roadmap.
- **Search | UI/UX:** Search and navigation work ok. But disappear occasionaly or trigger the side-rail inadvertantly. Create a PR if you have a fix or proposal.
- **Conservative reconnect:** If a stream drops, it reconnects — but not seamlessly. There is a noticeable recovery flow rather than a transparent resume.

If any of these affects you, they are also great places to contribute.

## Requirements

| Requirement | Version | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Xcode** | 26 or newer | Required for Swift 6.2, the tvOS 26 SDK, and the updated Swift Testing and SwiftData APIs this project uses. Earlier Xcode builds will not open the workspace correctly. |
| **Swift** | 6.2 | CloudX runs with strict concurrency checking set to `complete`. Swift 6.2 makes this possible without painful workarounds — the compiler enforces actor isolation at build time, which means a successful build is a strong safety guarantee. |
| **tvOS SDK** | 26.0 | The deployment target. Both the simulator and any real device need to be running tvOS 26. |
| **Mac** | Apple Silicon recommended | The vendored WebRTC framework ships with `arm64` simulator slices. Intel Macs will have a harder time running the simulator path. |
| **Apple TV** | Simulator or device | Most flows work in the Apple TV simulator. A real Apple TV is needed for performance profiling work and real-network streaming tests. |

> **Always open `CloudX.xcworkspace`, not `Apps/CloudX/CloudX.xcodeproj`.** There are two ways to open this project and one of them breaks things. The workspace is what ties the app and its seven local Swift packages together. Opening the project file directly causes missing dependency errors. This is worth saying twice because it is the most common first mistake.

---

## Quick Start

**1. Clone the repository.**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nafields/cloudx.git
cd cloudx
```

**2. Open the workspace — not the project file.**
```bash
open CloudX.xcworkspace
```
This opens the app together with all seven of its local Swift packages. Xcode will resolve the package graph automatically on first open — this takes a moment.

**3. Select the `CloudX-Debug` scheme.**
In Xcode's toolbar, click the scheme picker and select **CloudX-Debug**. This is the everyday development scheme.

**4. Choose an Apple TV simulator.**
In the destination picker, select **Apple TV 4K (3rd generation)** or any Apple TV simulator from the list.

**5. Build and run.**
Press **Cmd+R**. The first build compiles all seven Swift packages and takes a few minutes. Incremental builds are fast after that.

**What you'll see on first boot:** A sign-in screen asking you to visit a URL and enter a short code. This is Microsoft's device-code authentication flow — the standard auth approach for TV platforms where typing a password is impractical. You need a Microsoft account with an active Game Pass Ultimate subscription to get past this screen.

<details>
<summary>Build from the command line instead</summary>

The repo provides a validation wrapper that handles all the flags for you:

```bash
bash Tools/dev/run_debug_build.sh
```

Or, if you need a manual invocation:

```bash
xcodebuild -workspace CloudX.xcworkspace \
  -scheme CloudX-Debug \
  -sdk appletvsimulator \
  -destination 'platform=tvOS Simulator,name=Apple TV 4K (3rd generation),OS=latest' \
  ARCHS=arm64 ONLY_ACTIVE_ARCH=YES \
  build
```

</details>

## Architecture Overview

CloudX is organized as a workspace-first monorepo. One Xcode workspace ties a single tvOS app target together with seven local Swift packages. The packages are layered: lower ones provide building blocks, higher ones orchestrate them, and the app target owns only presentation and composition.

```
                 CloudXModels
                      │
                  (shared types, IDs, wire shapes — no dependencies)
                      │
   ┌──────────────────┼──────────────────┐
   │                  │                  │
DiagnosticsKit   InputBridge         XCloudAPI
 (logging,        (gamepad,          (auth, catalog,
  metrics)         input queue)       Xbox HTTP clients)
   │                  │                  │
   └──────────────────┼──────────────────┘
                      │
                 StreamingCore
              (WebRTC session, SDP/ICE,
               data channels, runtime contracts)
                      │
      ┌───────────────┼───────────────┐
      │                               │
VideoRenderingKit                CloudXCore
 (render strategy,              (controllers, hydration,
  upscale logic)                 boot coordination,
                                 stream orchestration)
      └───────────────┬───────────────┘
                      │
                 Apps/CloudX
          (SwiftUI shell, Metal rendering,
           WebRTC integration, presentation)
```

**The rule that makes this work:** packages never depend on the app target. `CloudXModels` sits at the bottom with no local dependencies. This means the networking layer, streaming runtime, and input handling can all be tested independently — without launching the app, without a simulator, without a network connection.

**What happens when you tap a game title:** The app resolves your auth tokens through `XCloudAPI`, creates a stream session through `StreamingCore`, exchanges WebRTC signaling with Microsoft's servers, and hands the resulting peer connection to a Metal-backed renderer in the app target. Your controller inputs go back to the server through `InputBridge` at 125 Hz. The entire lifecycle is orchestrated by `CloudXCore`.

For the full picture — boot sequence, actor-isolation model, persistence — see [`Docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](Docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## How to Contribute

The best first contributions are ones that start small and build familiarity: fixing a doc that confused you, adding a test for a package behavior you traced through the code, improving a Xcode preview harness, or picking up a "not yet" item from [`Docs/FEATURE_INVENTORY.md`](Docs/FEATURE_INVENTORY.md). The codebase is thoroughly documented specifically to make this kind of exploration tractable — every subsystem has a doc that explains what it is and why it exists.

To make a change: install the git hooks once (`bash Tools/hooks/install_git_hooks.sh`), read the architecture docs for whatever surface you are changing, use the narrowest validation lane that honestly proves your change works, and write a PR description that explains what changed and why. Full details in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md). Community standards in [`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
